# Supervised Vector Machines
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane.

There are 3 [parameters](https://medium.com/all-things-ai/in-depth-parameter-tuning-for-svc-758215394769) we can tune during model training: 
- kernel (select the type of hyperplane to separate the data); 
- c (regularization parameter; penalty parameter of the error term, it controls the trade off between smooth decision boundary and classifying the training points correctly); 
- gamma (a parameter for non linear hyperplanes; the higher the gamma values it tries to exactly fit the training data set)

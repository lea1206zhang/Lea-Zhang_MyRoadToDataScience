  - [NYC Short Term Rental Property Analysis](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/blob/master/R%20Project/NYC%20Short%20Rental%20Property%20Analysis/R%20markdown%20Report.pdf): Create a R shiny app and 3 individual metrics to find the most profitable zipcodes acorss New York City.
  - [IBM HR Analytics](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/tree/master/R%20Project/IBM%20Attrition%20Analysis): Clean dataset of 32 attributes on ~2K employees; achieve 72.5% accuracy score by building logistic regression and tested using PCA, 10-fold cross validation and applying AUC (Area Under Curve) and confusion matrix to measure performance and optimize model.
  - [2008 Democratic Primaries - Clinton vs. Obama](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/tree/master/R%20Project/2008%20Democratic%20Primaries%20-%20Clinton%20vs.%20Obama): Create a model to predict the winning spread of Obama over Clinton measured as percentage of the total vote. Apply a K-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of the chosen model. Based on analysis, recommend voter segment to target with their campaign messages. 
- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lea.zhang#!/): Analyze all the aspects that influence corporate travelers to minimize their travel time, such as departure delay, arrival delay and weather delay among different regions and airlines. Constructed 12 interactive dashboards and integrate them in one story to demonstrate the suggestions for business traveler (Coca Cola).
- SQL

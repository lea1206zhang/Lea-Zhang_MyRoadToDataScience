- R Project
  - [IBM HR Analytics](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/tree/master/R%20Project/IBM%20Attrition%20Analysis): Cleaned dataset of 32 attributes on ~2K employees; achieved 72.5% accuracy score by building logistic regression and tested using PCA, 10-fold cross validation and applying AUC (Area Under Curve) and confusion matrix to measure performance and optimize model.
  - [2008 Democratic Primaries - Clinton vs. Obama](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/tree/master/R%20Project/2008%20Democratic%20Primaries%20-%20Clinton%20vs.%20Obama): Created a model to predict the winning spread of Obama over Clinton measured as percentage of the total vote. Applied a K-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of the chosen model. Based on analysis, recommended voter segment to target with their campaign messages. 
- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lea.zhang#!/):Analyzed all the aspects that influence corporate travelers to minimize their travel time, such as departure delay, arrival delay and weather delay among different regions and airlines. Constructed 12 interactive dashboards and integrated them in one story to demonstrate the suggestions for business traveler (Coca Cola).
- SQL

  - [Pandas Basics](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/blob/master/SQL/Pandas_Basics_Complete.ipynb):Using SQL in Python.
  - [Major League Baseball Analytics](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/blob/master/SQL/Major%20League%20Baseball%20Analytics.ipynb):Queried a database containing pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 to 2016. Used JOIN, common table expressions and window functions to examine the trend of ranking and team dynamics for Atlanta Braves, and compared the performance and status of non-league champion with league champion.

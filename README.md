  - [IBM HR Analytics](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/tree/master/R%20Project/IBM%20Attrition%20Analysis): Cleaned dataset of 32 attributes on ~2K employees; achieved 72.5% accuracy score by building logistic regression and tested using PCA, 10-fold cross validation and applying AUC (Area Under Curve) and confusion matrix to measure performance and optimize model.
  - [2008 Democratic Primaries - Clinton vs. Obama](https://github.com/lea1206zhang/Lea-Zhang_MyRoadToDataScience/tree/master/R%20Project/2008%20Democratic%20Primaries%20-%20Clinton%20vs.%20Obama): Created a model to predict the winning spread of Obama over Clinton measured as percentage of the total vote. Applied a K-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of the chosen model. Based on analysis, recommended voter segment to target with their campaign messages.

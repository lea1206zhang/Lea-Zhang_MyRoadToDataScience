# Obama Campaign and A/B Testing 
# Overview of the Case

The Obama 2008 campaign used analytics to increase donations using A/B testing.The campaign tried four buttons and six different media (three images and three videos). A full- factorial multivariate test was used to statistically test all the combinations of buttons and media against each other at the same time. Since there were four buttons and six different media that meant a total of 24 (4 x 6) total combinations to test. Every visitor to the splash page was randomly shown one of these combinations and we tracked whether they signed up or not.

The winning variation had a sign-up rate of 11.6%. The original page had a sign-up rate of 8.26%. That’s an improvement of 40.6% in sign-up rate. What does an improvement of 40.6% translate into? Instead of having nearly 10 million people signed up for the campaign, the original page would have obtained only close to 7,120,000 signups. That is a difference of 2,880,000 email addresses. These additional email addresses are essentially responsible for 288,000 more volunteers and an addition $60millions in donations.

This created a new culture, and the Obama 2012 campaign also used data analytics and the experimental method to assemble a winning coalition vote by vote. In doing so, it overturned the long dominance of TV advertising in U.S. politics and created something new in the world: a national campaign run like a local ward election, where the interests of individual voters were known and addressed [1].

# Data

As of February 19, 2008, of the 2,868 total counties for which county-level vote data would eventually become available, there were 1,131 counties left to report. An estimated 2,490 delegates were already committed, and 2,118 were needed to secure the party’s nomination; there were still 1,744 delegates to be awarded in upcoming states’ primaries and caucuses. (See Exhibit 1 for a list of past and upcoming primaries and caucuses.) Later that evening, the results of Hawaii’s caucus and Wisconsin’s primary would be announced. In these two states, and in over 1,000 counties in other states, it remained to be seen who would vote for Clinton and who would vote for Obama. Whoever won the most votes in these remaining primaries was likely to become the next POTUS.

|               | Vote          | Demographic/county data|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Training set  | Available     | Available     |   
| Testing set   | Not Available | Available     | 


# Objective 

I would use the primaries and caucuses results before February 19, 2008 (1131 rows) to predict the results of the remaining 1131 rows.

The issue occurs when a carrier has the first or second highest average delay on a day but has fewer than 5 flights on that day.  Consider what happens on 1/1/2007.  Carrier \"B6\" has the highest average delay of 60 minutes, but it only has 4 flights on that day.  So, it is correctly moved to the back of the rankings.  BUT, carrier \"NW\" (which has an average delay of 55 minutes, 9 total flights, and therefore should be ranked first on 1/1/2007) is actually ranked second?  Why?  Because in the 'RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY Date_Col ORDER BY AD DESC)' command, the window function does not know to exclude the B6 carrier from the ranking (as we might hope it would).  Thus, B6 is still implicitly ranked 1st, in the window frame created by the window function ORDER BY subclause, which moves NW to 2nd.***</mark>"
